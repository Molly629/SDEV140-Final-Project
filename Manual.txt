Currently the newest and only manual, self-serve POS program for massive Smoothie Company "Smoothie Castle" equipt with all the funtions 
you need in order to own and operate the program. First you must download the executable file, and then extract it to begin
usage. From there all you should need to do is double-click on the program icon and you well be greeted by our welcome screen.
To exit the application, press the Quit button, But to put in an order, you're gonna have to press the Order button. From there 
you can view all available flavors, all of them are the same dollar amount. From the flavor selection screen, you will need to 
pick the size of your smoothie. Whichever size you pick, you will be delivered to a seperate order screen for each detailing
your total. Getting payment information wasn't in the scope of this project. All you can do from this screen is view your total
and select Exit to quit the application.
